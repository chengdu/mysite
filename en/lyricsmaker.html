        <h1>LyricsMaker<br><em>Version 1.2</em></h1>
        <p class="greenbig">The designedly util to make lyrics sheets easy.</p>
        <p class="lead"><b>LyricsMaker</b> is a small util that was designed to conveniently make lyrics sheet for music or generate subtitle for movie, and later them can be easily synthesised by <a href="littlefox.html">LitterFox</a>. It do one thing in a simple way, i.e, listen audio or watch video and make time marks by simple clicks.</p>
    </div>
    


<p>The app generate accurate lyrics sheet or subtitle file using two file, i.e, an audio or video file and a plain text file, so the text file required to be prepared to match the audio or video content before processing. The app was designed to simplify the work of synchronising subtitle with audio or video. In daily usage scenarios, you needs to listen audio or watch video only once.</p>

<p class="greenbig"><span class="strike0">It's free!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lyricsmaker/id1411706886?ls=1&mt=12" target="_blank" class="appstore_download_link"><img src="../images/available_on_macappstore.png" style="margin-left:1em;"> </a></p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>If you can't open the link above, please launch App Store and found LyricsMaker by searching.</p>


<p class="block" style="display:none;">
From May 2020, LyricsMaker turned to be a paid app, because thousands of people downloaded it but no one to rate it on App Store. Why? The developer spent so many time to craftily make a software but Why nobody willing to spent one second to make a click to respect other's work and appreciate other's work?  People get other's free service but even no thanks in their heart, why? It will return to be free again forever if somebody do some kind thing for it.
<em>Sorry, from May 2020, LyricsMaker turned to be a paid app, it will return to be free again forever if somebody do some kind things for it.</em></p>
