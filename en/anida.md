Small! Fast! It's the audio artificial intelligence era!


Anida  is an audio codec and audio compression format developed by Sevenuc Consulting. It was designed to reduce audio data size to reduce transfer time and save disk space. The Anida engine was designed as a KAM (Kilobytes Audio Machine) for deeply embedded system running on small devices and has a small footprint, it promised to compress common music files with kilobytes as opposed to megabytes.


From ICQ to AAI, the next generation of Help Desk Service System based on:

TTS (Text-to-speech system, speech synthesis) + ASR (automatic speech recognition) + AI (artificial intelligence) + Anida.

* (AAI: audio artificial intelligence, the brand new abbreviation word created by Sevenuc Consulting.)*


## Why Anida?

-  Save Storage Space.  Very high compression of Anida audio codec can be used to save storage space from large scale music sharing sites, live chat app and games, to embedded systems running on small devices. High compression is also very important for end users, who don't want to save 85% and more large storage space in his mobile phone?

-  High Performance. .
* Reduce user wait times. *

a. Fast decoding speed. Whether running native machine code that compiled from C code or running javascript code that embedded in web page.
b. Fast transfer files with an ultra small file size neither play audio on a web page nor on a mobile phone. It's an important factor to impact your end user's experience, especially the networks that has narrow bandwidth, e.g the mobile networks.


-  Save Energy.  Small audio data file can save so many energy, save large cost of current running applications. Anida audio codec was designed to upgrade the current popular audio codecs used in Instant Messengers, softphone and VoIP.


## Features

1.  Very high compression , smaller than popular audio codecs. Very high compression is the strength and advantage of Anida audio codec in comparison to other audio codecs: such as SILK (used by Skype), AAC (used in MP4), Speex, 3gp AMR, Opus, X264, GSM6.10, G729, G711, G722 and normal audio format such as MP3, M4A, Ogg and WMA.  According to it's extremely small data output and fast decoding speed, it can be easily applied to large number of technology and product , especially live streaming audio, live chat in game and app, music share solution, music player and video player development, TV, new multimedia design, new animation and video format design.


2. Universal audio compression, best balanced compression rate and quality, has the ability to convert almost all legacy audio from low bitrate to very high bitrate audio format with any sample rate, most legacy audio formats on Unix, Macintosh, Windows, Linux and Other platforms, such as PSP, Xbox etc.


3. Very suitable for remote music share, radio channels, online TV, video conferencing, in-game chat, music player, audio book, voice mail, Instant Messengers, Chat Apps (such as Jabber, ICQ, Skype, Viber, Google Hangouts, WhatsApp, LINE, Kik, Slack, Telegram, etc), translation assistant, softphone (TextME, TalkCall etc) and VoIP (X-Lite, Zoiper etc).


4. Adaptable for common protocols such as RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol), WebRTC (Web Realtime Communication), and industry standard RTP (Realtime Transport Protocol) and RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).


5. Small footprint, simple, and easy-to-use, designed for deeply embedded systems, written with ANSI C without extra dependencies (except the standard ANSI libc, several mathematical functions and I/O access) and can be easily ported to all platform and bind to all common programming languages.

## Simple Comparison Table:

Audio Codec Comparison:


File Name 	  Wav  	  MP3  	  Anida

Yesterday Once More - Carpenters	 42.6MB 	 3.9MB 	  482KB

Chances - Air Supply	 37.9MB 	 3.4MB 	  428KB

Heal the World - Michael Jackson	 67.9MB 	 6.2MB 	  767KB

Total: 	  148.4 MB  	  13.5 MB  	  1.6 MB

The result made from three music files, they are counted in wav, mp3, and Anida formats.


Sample App Comparison:


Case No. 	  Number of
songs 	  MP3  	  Anida  	  Saved
Storage

App 1 	 150 	 846.9 MB 	 42 MB 	  95% !

App 2 	 318 	 1777.8 MB 	 149 MB 	  92% !


Obviously, Anida based on products can save large number of storage!
