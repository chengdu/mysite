<h2>Challenge Yourself!</h2>
<p>There is an ancient DOS game from 1980s, Chinese Chess Master III ( 將族 III), the AI algorithm of the game is amazing powerful! The AI engine doesn't use any deep learning algorithms that almost every modern AI app used.

How powerful the chess players in this game are unknown! AlphaGo run with distributed 1,920 CPUs and 280 GPU and more, but this DOS game is only 926KB running on one CPU with 64KB memory!
