        <p class="lead"><i>
<a href="http://www.sevenuc.com/en/speare.html">Speare</a> is a small and friendly code editor. It was originally developed to provide a native scripting language debugging environment that seamlessly integrated with C and C++. You can use it to edit source code files, programming and debugging. Speare designed to make programming feels light, simple and free. Speare not only has an efficient code navigation and call routines tracing ability but also has flexibility to extend it to support special developing requirements. Speare includes an ultra lightweight debugging environment for C, C++, Ruby, mruby, Lua, Python, PHP, Perl and Tcl, and give people complete freedom to control and customise the debugging environment for a new programming language.</i></p>
    </div>

<h2 class="dark">What's new</h2>
<p class="dark">1. Syntax highlighting files that has no extension name by recognising it's Shebang.<br>
2. Parallel editing mode: fast editing arbitrary files in parallel text views, the most important feature.<br>
(version 1.2.404, release date: Jul 11 2021)
</p>

<!--p class="greenbig">It's free!</p-->
<div style="display:none;">
<h2>It's not free now!</h2>
<p>Speare has really good features, such as parallel editing, instant diff, high performance searching and symbol definition parsing. But after a long time, still no people kindly feed back any issue report or feature request, they just use it freely but don't willing to give respect to other's works. I changed my idea from "Free Forever" to "You should pay for good stuff". The app is really good but they made it down and down, that's made me angry, that's why Speare becomes a paid app from free app. Sorry.

<p><a href="../images/speare/debug_sqlite_with_speare_code_editor.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/speare/debug_sqlite_with_speare_code_editor.png" class="screenshots"/></a><br><br>
Screenshot of <a href="https://sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a> source code "Parallel Editing" in Speare code editor, "Parallel Editing" mode allows user stick one file in the bottom view and switch different files in the top view.<br><br>

Using .diff files with the help of "Parallel Editing" mode has obvious advantage, copy code blocks in the bottom text view and fast switch different files in the top text view can efficiently edit files very fast, and Speare can index .diff files for big file changes very well comparing to other code editor and IDEs. And, Spear enable user edit arbitrary two souce code file side by side and also support edit source code file with built-in web browser side by side.

<h2>Fast edit several files separately</h2>
<p>Just drag the file one by one from Finder and drop into workspace, edit them and then right-click to "Remove All".</p>

<h2>Fast edit several files in big folder</h2>
<p>Just drag the folder into workspace never mind how big it is and then edit several files never mind what the programming language they were written, fast editing them with the <b>"Auto-completion"</b> feature provided by Speare code editor.</p>

<h2>Code editor on iPad</h2>
<p>If you want to edit source code files on iPad, or review code on iPad, please refer another app developed by me, <a href="powerreader.html">iCodeEditor</a>, an integrated code editor for iPad. Sorry, it's not free.</p>

<h2>Code editor and IDE on macOS</h2>
<p class="small"><b>Diamond is small! Emphasise small software is never too much!</b><br>
E.g. iTerm2 is better than Terminal.app, the latter is only 8.3MB, but the former is about 69MB! it's so big! so I throw it away immediately! neovim bring some excitements to developers, but it's still too big! bare installation is at least 25MB! and boring configurations! so I give up it immediately! I really don't know how big it will be if I configured up all languages! Although terminal based on text editors such as GNU Emacs and Vim, looks so cool, but their limitations are also obvious, the elephant in the room. As a programmer, so many text editor I've used in the past years, such as the bulky cargos, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Android Studio, Eclipse, ActiveState Komodo, Xcode, NetBeans, Eclipse, and some light cargos, e.g. Textadept, CotEditor and TextMate. TextMate is my favour many years, but I never use it anymore when Speare become to be the alternative, and I never try TextMate2 because of the same one reason, too big! I never like desktop applications that built with NodeJS, React and Electron, Eclipse and Java or .NET and C# based big stuffs. So, an extremely small code editor is the design goal of Speare to pursue, and also the design philosophy of this unique dev utility. Speare code editor was implemented extremely small but has the most important missing features in common code editors, such as code completion, parallel editing, instant diff, bookmark management, code block live parsing and efficiently tracing call routines, etc.<br>
<!--b>Any software that has big runtime and tedious configurations should be despised as garbage!</b-->

<p>Speare code editor was developing based on the native pure Cocoa frameworks with leveraging several C library results a very small footprint, high performance, small memory and storage runtime consuming, and ultra small distribution. Only 1.1MB executable!</p>

<h2>Why not big software?</h2>
<p>Waste time to maintain, wast big storage and runtime memory, waste energy, waste time to upload and download. It's waste people's life! Every desktop developer should known one thing, the embedded system developers sometime even fighting for one byte of storage in some situation. They never think about memory and storage like embedded system developers, so more and more big monster there. In today's software industry, Unix philosophy has been throw away completely!</p>

<p class="green"><i>They make software as big as possible, as complex as possible, but I believe in the opposite philosophy.</i></p>

<h2>Why another code editor and IDE on macOS?</h2>
<p>Despite there are so many code editor and IDE available on macOS, but Speare code editor has its own unique characteristics:<br>
<ul><li><lt>Lightweight.</lt> Most of the code editors on macOS are very heavy, bulky! But Speare code editor is really really ultra light!</li>
<li><lt>High Performance.</lt> Code editor developed with Javascript or Java have inherent defects that can't keep high performance when handle thousands of files for big project, such as VSCode, Atom, and NetBeans, Eclipse. Speare code editor can handle very big project, for very big C &amp; C++ projects, Java projects, Node projects, and very big game projects! Easily!</li>
<li><lt>Freedom.</lt> Feels light, simple and free. High performance code editor, flexibility to extend it to support special developing requirements and easily add a new programming language, most of these IDE on macOS can't give you such ability and freedom, can't give you smoothly coding experience when mixing multiple programming languages for big software projects. But Speare code editor give you very flexible control to extend it to add syntax highlighting for a special document and debugging environment for a new programming language.

<h2>Code browser, call routines tracing and code analysis</h2>
<p>Speare code editor helps end user to understand an existing code base by powerful code browser and call routines tracing functions. Speare code editor parses source code files and maintains the database of symbol definitions instantly while user editing, and presents useful contextual information to user automatically. It also use persistent bookmarks to remember key locations within functions or classes and their references. End user can quickly navigate function calls and callers and find references to variable, function or class instantly.</p>

<h2>Productive helps to fast find editing points</h2>
<p><ul><li> Use "Recent List" to fast find recent opened and edited files.</li>
<li> Use "Functions" to fast find the location of function definitions.</li>
<li> Use "Bookmarks" to fast find the bookmarks placed for editing locations.</li>
<li> Search symbol references and fast find the location of the reference points.</li>
<li> Use "Parallel Editing" to fast edit files.</li>
<li> Drag file or folder in the workspace to re-arrange their positions.</li>
<li> Search items in the workspace.</li>
<li> Use "Jump To Definition" to find the reference points, and click "Go Back" to return to jump point.</li>
<li> Use "Changes" to fast find file changes.</li></ul></p>


<h2>Fast Editing</h2>
<p>Speare developed as an ultra light code editor that completely leverage "Keyboard shortcuts" for fast editing. Keyboard shortcuts instead of "moving mouse and click" can notably improve code editing experience. Real programmer use keyboard shortcuts as a habit constantly. Real programmer use and write command line applications as a habit constantly. Keyboard shortcuts can help people fast move focus between workspace and text editor, and fast switch between running apps such as Debug Server, Fossil, Web browser and Speare.
