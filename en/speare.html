<h2 class="dark">What's new</h2>
<p class="dark">1. Improvement of "Lite Mode", i.e. without toolbar and hidden workspace, this is useful and feels more light when open and edit several file but not work on a project that has large number of files. This function turn Speare to a TextEdit-like text editor but has more features, such as line number display, syntax highlighting etc.<br>
2. Highlighting files that has no extension name by recognise it's Shebang, i.e. the first line of the text file.
</p>


<h2>Fast edit several files separately</h2>
<p>Just drag the file one by one from Finder and drop into workspace, edit them and then right-click to "Remove All".</p>


<h2>Fast edit several files in big folder</h2>
<p>Just drag the folder into workspace never mind how big it is and then edit several files never mind what the programming language they were written, fast editing them with the <b>"Auto-completion"</b> feature provided by Speare code editor.</p>


<h2>Code editor on iPad</h2>
<p>If you want to edit source code files on iPad, or review code on iPad, please refer another app developed by me, <a href="powerreader.html">iCodeEditor</a>, an integrated code editor for iPad. Sorry, it's not free.</p>

<h2>Code editor and IDE on macOS</h2>
<p class="small">Terminal based on text editors such as GNU Emacs and Vim, although they are very cool, but their limitations are also obvious, the elephant in the room. As a programmer, so many text editor I've used in the past years, such as the bulky cargos, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Android Studio, Eclipse, ActiveState Komodo, Xcode, NetBeans, Eclipse, and some light cargos, e.g Textadept, CotEditor and TextMate. I never like desktop applications that built with NodeJS, React and Electron, Eclipse and Java or .NET and C# based big stuffs. Speare code editor is a small, free and friendly code editor which implements the most important missing features in common code editors, e.g bookmark management, parallel editing, instant diff and fast locate code lines between multiple files, code block live parsing etc.

<p>Speare code editor was developing based on the native pure Cocoa frameworks with leveraging several C library results a very small footprint, high performance, small memory and storage runtime consuming, and ultra small distribution. Only 1.1MB executable!</p>


<h2>Why not big software?</h2>
<p>Waste time to maintain, wast big storage and runtime memory, waste power, waste time to upload and download. It's waste people's life! Every desktop developer should known one thing, the embedded system developers sometime even fighting for one byte of storage in some situation. They never think about memory and storage like embedded system developers, so more and more big monster there. In today's software industry, Unix philosophy has been throw away completely!</p>

<p class="green">They make software as big as possible, as complex as possible, but I believe in the opposite philosophy. </p>

<h2>Why another code editor and IDE on macOS?</h2>
<p>Although there are so many code editor and IDE available on macOS, but four feature of Speare code editor can make it unique:<br>
<ol><li><lt>Lightweight.</lt> Most of the code editors on macOS are very heavy, bulky! But Speare code editor is really really ultra light. Only 6.2MB! </li>
<li><lt>High Performance.</lt> Code editor developed with Javascript or Java have inherent defects that can't keep high performance when handle thousands of files for big project, such as VSCode, Atom, and NetBeans, Eclipse. Speare code editor can handle very big project, for very big C &amp; C++ projects, Java projects, Node projects, and very big game projects! Easily!</li>
<li><lt>Cost.</lt> Most of them are not free, and even very expensive, such as Sublime Text, CodeRunner and <span class="strike">BBEDIT</span> etc, but Speare code editor is free! Of course, you can kindly purchase the pro version to donate some money to the author, but that is not mandatory.</li>
<li><lt>Freedom.</lt> Feels light, simple and free. High performance code editor, flexibility to extend it to support special developing requirements and easily add a new programming language, most of these IDE on macOS can't give you such ability and freedom, can't give you smoothly coding experience when mixing multiple programming languages for big software projects. In fact, Speare code editor give you very flexible control to extend it to add syntax highlighting for a special document and debugging environment for a new programming language.
</li>

6. Drag file or folder in the workspace to re-arrange their positions.<br>
7. Search items in the workspace.<br>
8. Use "Jump To Definition" to find the reference points, and click "Go Back" to return to jump point.<br>
9. Use "Changes" to fast find file changes.
</p>


<h2>Lite Mode</h2>
<p>Click main menu "View" → "Hide Toolbar". "Lite Mode" can turn Speare to be a concise text editor that let user feels more light when open and edit several files but not work on a project that has a large number of files. Under "Lite Mode", please switch workspace views by select menu items of "Navigate" replace of click toolbar items.
</p>


<h2>Debug Mode</h2>
<p>Speare seamlessly support debugging C, C++, Ruby, mruby, Lua, Python, PHP, Perl and Tcl script, more info see here: <a href="debugger.html" target="_blank" > → Speare debugger architecture</a>.</p>

<h2>Techniques Inside</h2>
<p><b>Speare is very fast!</b><br> Speare developed with pure Cocoa and C components that made it completely different with Javascript & Chromium based on IDE that large number of junk filled inside them, pure native frameworks and C modules made it small, efficient and has ability to leverage all native platform built-in features, e.g. Spell and grammar check, font and text format, unlimited undo, text to speak etc.</p>
-->

<div style="display:none;">
<h2>Speare on Apple App Store</h2>
<p>This small code editor is one of the top best-sales developer tool on App Store, thousands of copy have been downloaded from 2019 and people across the planet using it for editing everyday. But Speare even can't be put on the Top 200 free developer tools!  Can't believe that!  Yes! <w>App Store will surprise you if you developed a software that conflict with the benefit of these gentlemen!  Even Speare can easily beat any of the top-sales free code editor, text editor, or paid developer tools such as Markdown editor, HTML editor! Speare still can't display in the top 200 free developer tools to let more people easily find it!</w></p>

<p><b class="greenbig">Note:</b> One thing you must know is, they do very bad things on Apple App Store, these gentlemen leaves bad comments on the "rate and comment" of some good apps or vice versa to mislead people, and even drop off some apps from top-sales when the apps conflict with their benefit, so please judge one app's value by yourself instead of what they said.
