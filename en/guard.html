        <h1>Guard7<br><em>Version 1.2</em></h1>
        <p class="lead"><b>Guard7</b> is a general purpose cryptography tool that used to encrypt or decrypt email, file, sign and verify files. It is the graphical frontend for the GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG, <a href="http://www.gnupg.org">http://www.gnupg.org</a>) on macOS (previously Mac OS X) with additional features. Guard7 is an encryption and decryption system based on industry standard that can ensure the complete security of business negotiations or personal messages. It was developed to make the daily work with GnuPG on <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">macOS</a> easy and simple.</p>
    </div>
    


<p class="greenbig">It's free!</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guard7/id1348667059?ls=1&mt=12" target="_blank" class="appstore_download_link"><img src="../images/available_on_macappstore.png" style="margin-left:1em;"> </a></p><br><br><br><br>
<p><em>If you can't open the link above, please launch App Store and found Guard7 by searching. Please kindly donate the author by purchasing other apps developed by the author or commend this app on your blog or rate this app so that helping other people can more easily find it.</em></p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p class="block">The most difference between "public key cryptography" and normal "password protected cryptography" is that the first approach don't ask you to distribute any password to anyone or any unsafe place, e.g. email, chat app, or internet. That is, you send an encrypted message or file to someone, but don't need send any password to him/her. And the most important point is, you need an encryption tool that has industrial strength to protect your confidential information.</p>


<h2>General Features</h2>
<ul><li>Group and subkey management.</li>
<li>Drag operation for group organisation, easily manage hundreds of contacts by company and department.</li>
<li>Seamlessly integrated with the built-in Mail app of macOS, easily organise dozens of recipients for email message.</li>
<li>Encrypt, Decrypt email and file by conveniently dragging operation.</li>
<li>Multiple keyring management. Switch between different keyring just requires a simple click.</li>
<li>Import keyring and key from Linux, Mac, Windows and Unix, compatible with GnuPG 1.x and 2.x version and OpenPGP.</li>
<li>Query, download or upload key to PGP key servers.</li>
<li>Easily manage key and subkeys, edit key by simple click.</li>
<li>Without complex installation, configuration or double boring questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="warning" style="font-size:14px;">Dangerous Operation</h2>
<p>
<span class="warning" style="font-size:12px;">a. Don't import Keyring as public key.<br>
b. Don't import key files that wasn't generated by Guard7.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(signature file, public key and private key)<br>
The above two operation both are very dangerous.<br>
They may crush your database and can't recover your data.</span><br>
</p>


<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>You don't need to have deep knowledge of <b>"Public Key Cryptography"</b> at all, you can get industry-level strength information protection with just a few simple steps.</p>

<ol><li><b>Generate a key pair for yourself.</b><br>
Click <img src="../images/guard/keys.png" class="icon" /> and the system will generate a public and private key pair for you. You should send the public key to others who can then encrypt message for you. The private key is used to decrypt message and must be keeping for yourself. You SHOULD NOT send your private key to anybody, but keep it for yourself VERY CAREFULLY.<br><br>
<b>Note: </b>This operation is very time-consuming, please wait a while with patient.<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>Distribute your public key.</b><br>
Select your key, right click the node and then select "Export Public Key", your public key file will be created. Put your public key in a GPG server, your web site or send it directly to others via chat app, email or other channel.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Import other people's public key.</b><br>
Ask someone else to send his public key to you, or if he has already distributed his public key on GPG server, you need to download it and then simply drag the key file into the left side treeview to import it.<br><br>
click the "+" symbol or click <img src="../images/guard/menu.png" class="icon" /> and then select the "Import Public Key" menu or directly drag the key file into the left side treeview to complete the operation.<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>Use other people's public key to encrypt message, and then sent to them.</b><br>
Drag their email (public key) into the right side drop-area as recipients, and then encrypt your message or file.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Decrypt message with your own private key.</b><br>
If someone else has your public key, they can encrypt message with your public key, and then you can decrypt the message with your private key. When you decrypt a message or file, or verify file signature, you don't required to do any extra actions. The system will automatically use the default master key that you set to do the operation, i.e., you don't need to choose your own private key manually.</li>
</ol>

<p>Encrypt or sign file follows the same steps and principles.</p>

<h2>Group Contacts</h2>
<p>Organise your contacts by company and department. <br></p>
<ul><li>Click <img src="../images/guard/group.png" class="icon" /> to add new group.</li>
<li>Click the minus symbol '-' under the tree to delete key or group.</li>
<li>Add key to group: drag the primary key to the group that you want it belongs to.</li>
<li>Delete association between key and group: drag the primary key out of the group to a blank space.</li>
<li>Edit group name: click the group then edit its name just like in Finder.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: </b><em>Drag operation only available for the primary keys that always display an email address.</em></p>

<h2>File Types</h2>
<ul>
<li><img src="../images/guard/asc.png" class="fileicon" />: .asc files, key file or signed signature file.</li>
<li><img src="../images/guard/gml.png" class="fileicon" />: .gml files, encrypted email message.</li>
<li><img src="../images/guard/gpg.png" class="fileicon" />: .gpg files, encrypted and compressed File.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Name Rules</b><br>
<em>Public key has format: xx@xx_pubkey.asc.<br> Private key has format: xx@xx_privkey.asc.</em></p>

<h2>Recipients Organisation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Drag single key or several group form left side treeview into drop-area, single key means an individual and a group means all recipients in it.</li>
  <li>Right click to see more details of the selected key.</li>
  <li>Right click to remove some recipients.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Drag multiple groups into the drop-area enable you quickly organise dozens of recipients to receive your file or message. But if you use a command line software or other tools, you will have to organise the recipients one by one, it's very time waste and boring.</em></p>


<h2>Operation with Finder</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Drag key file into the left side treeview then it will be imported.</li>
  <li>Drag encrypted file, signature file or message into the right side drop-area then you can decrypt, verify or read them.</li>
  <li>Select key file, signature file, encrypted file or message in Finder, right click "Open With" then you can import key, verify, decrypt or read the message.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Keyring Management</h2>
<p><em><b>keyring</b> is a package working like a folder that binding group info, public and private key together, it's a common compressed zip file when you export a keyring. The system will automatically create a keyring named as "home" for you if there's no any keyring exists when you run Guard7 at the first time.</em></p>
<p>Click "Preferences" on main menu.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Create new keyring. </b><br>
When your contacts are too many, such as hundreds or even thousands, or other reasons you need to create a separate keyring for a large number of contacts.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Import or export keyring.</b> <br>
You need to import keyring from other system, e.g. Linux, and when backup or change hardware you need to export keyring. Please compress your ~/.gpg on Linux as a tar file when you want to import it into Guard7.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Switch keyring</b>. <br>keyring enable you to organise group of contacts like folder and can conveniently switch between them.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Key Management</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Never send your private key to others.</li>
  <li>Keep your private key on a USB drive is a good method, but print it on paper and lock it in a safe will be more reliable.</li>
  <li>Backup your keyring carefully.</li>
  <li>Sign and encrypt messages with your subkey.</li>
  <li>Sign and encrypt files with your subkey.</li>
  <li>Verify a key in an efficient way is, directly make a phone call and ask he/she read out the fingerprint of his/her key.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>subkey: </b> the subnode under your primary key node (the node titled with your email address).</p>


<h2>Edit Key (optional)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reset passphrase.</li>
  <li>Reset expire date.</li>
  <li>Set the key as your default master key.</li>
  <li>Create subkey separately used for encrypt or signing.</li>
  <li>Sign key with a different trust level. There's five trust level:<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;1 = Don't know <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;2 = I do NOT trust <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;3 = I trust marginally <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;4 = I trust fully <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;5 = I trust ultimately <br>
   This option help you to decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' key and it is absolutely not necessary in daily usage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b>  edit key is not necessary in daily usage scenario.</p>

<h2>Simple Demonstration Session</h2>
<p>The following steps emulate a session between two person on a same machine, here assume they're Tom and Mary, the steps can help you get an overview understanding of how <b>"Public Key Cryptography"</b> works.</p>

<p><b>Step 1.</b> Create key pair for Tom and Mary:<br><br>

    <b>a.</b> Click <b>"GenKeys"</b> on toolbar to generate a key pair for Tom. <br>
    <b>b.</b> Select the created key and export Tom's public key and private key. <br>
    <b>c.</b> Click <b>"GenKeys"</b> on toolbar to generate a key pair for Mary. <br>
    <b>d.</b> Select the created key and export Mary's public key and private key. <br>
    Please give the key pair an easily remember password for test only. <br> <br>    

    Now, you have four key files: <br>
    <em>Tom@compnay_pubkey.asc <br>
    Tom@compnay_privkey.asc <br>
    Mary@compnay_pubkey.asc <br>
    Mary@compnay_privkey.asc </em><br><br>


<b>Step 2.</b> Tom create an encrypted file with Mary's public key: <br><br>

    <b>a.</b> Right click Tom's public key and then select <b>"Edit Key"</b>,
       input password and on the prompt dialog select <b>"Primary"</b>,
       check on <b>"set as your primary key"</b> and click <b>"Set as primary key"</b> button. <br>
    <b>b.</b> Remove all key of Mary from the left side tree view. <br>
    <b>c.</b> Drag Mary@compnay_pubkey.asc into the left side tree view 
       to emulate importing Mary's public key. <br>
    <b>d.</b> Drag the Mary's public key imported in the previous step 
       from left side to the right side table as a <b>Recipients</b>.<br>
    <b>e.</b> Drag a sample file from Finder into the right side table
       and then click <b>"Encrypt"</b> on the toolbar to encrypt it, 
       a compressed file with ".gpg" extension name will be created. <br><br>


<b>Step 3.</b> Mary decrypt the file with her own private key: <br><br>

    <b>a.</b> Remove all key from the left side tree view.<br>
    <b>b.</b> Drag Mary@compnay_pubkey.asc into the left side tree view 
       to import Mary's public key.<br>
    <b>c.</b> Drag Mary@compnay_privkey.asc into the left side tree view 
       to import Mary's private key.<br>
    <b>d.</b> Right click Mary's public key and then select <b>"Edit Key"</b>,
       input password and on the prompt dialog select <b>"Primary"</b>,
       check on <b>"set as your primary key"</b> and click <b>"Set as primary key"</b> button. <br>
    <b>e.</b> Drag the encrypted file that output from the step 2 and then click <b>"Decrypt"</b> 
       on the toolbar to decrypt it. <br><br>
