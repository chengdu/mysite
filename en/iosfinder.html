<h2>Why</h2>
<p><ul><li>
Select file or folder on MacBook → transfer and then view files on iPhone, or <br>
Select file or folder on iPhone → transfer and then view files on MacBook. <br>
<span class="greenbig">It's so intuitive and simple! <br>
But, syncing mechanism made it so boring!</span><br>
An iPhone can sync with only one computer at a time!<br>
Transferring files between iPhone and MacBook always drive me angry!<br><br></li>
<li class="greenbig">It's convenient but not necessary to store everything on cloud, there is still existing many reasons <br>
to store Office documents, photo, video and other files on private disk, computer or other storage devices <br>
to prevent the data be illegally accessed, used or analysed.</li></ul></p>

<p>Transferring files between Mac and iOS devices is always difficult and pain!<br>
You can't feel free to transfer files as intuitive as moving files in Finder!<br>
So, this app developed to help you manage files in your iOS devices just like on your MacBook!</p>

<p>The above video is very old, but demonstrate the app's features.</p>

<h2>Fast share files between your Mac, Windows PC or Linux, Android and iOS devices</h2>

<p>You can download all kinds of files from your Mac or PC and read them on your iOS devices. You can also upload any kinds of files to your Mac or PC from your iPhone or iPad. Browse eBooks and PDF files, read Office documents e.g. EXCEL, WORD and PowerPoint, view pictures by slipping your finger, listening musics like in iTunes and watching movies. Of course, the app can be emphasised using as a resource explorer like Finder on Mac. iOSFinder designed to be a P2P file share solution, you can directly move files between your desktop, server, mobile phone and iOS devices remotely.</p>

<h2>Read &amp; Review code on iPad</h2>
<p class="hilight">iOSFinder was renamed from <b>iCodeEditor</b>(another name is iPowerReader), means that it was originally developed to edit source code on iPad, in fact, yes, it actually a full featured code editor. This function was especially designed for anyone who wants to read or edit source code on iOS device.</p>
<ul>
<li> Syntax highlighting. Source code parser integrated and symbols indexed, such as module, class, function definition, variable declaration etc.</li>
<li> Symbol browse and filter. Search symbols in folder that holds large number of files.</li>
<li> Jump to symbol or jump to line. <b>Accurate line location by line number or by the symbol definition</b>.</li>
<li> Live web page preview. Preview website design with the builtin web browser, so convenient!</li>
<li> Read code or other files on iPhone is convenient and useful, but edit source code file on iPad will feel better.</li>
</ul>
<p>The editor supports <b>Syntax Highlighting</b> for almost all popular programming languages, including but not limited:</p>
<p class="small">Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL, MATLAB (with OO features), Asm (Assembler/Assembly language), <gr>Tcl</gr>, Ada, <gr>Fortran</gr>, Forth, Cobol, SML (Standard ML), S-Lang, Vim, <gr>LaTeX</gr>, Asciidoc, <gr>Markdown</gr>, Typescript, REXX, Flex, <gr>Lisp</gr>, Clojure, R, <gr>Rust</gr>, Haxe, OCaml (Objective Caml), Scheme, Apache, Pig, <gr>Awk</gr>, shell scripts, PowerShell, DOS batch, Basic, Asp, Pascal (Delphi/Object Pascal), Eiffel, <gr>Java</gr>, Scala, Groovy, gradle, XSLT, XSD, Xquery, WSDL, Snippets, nasl, Puppet, Sedona, Protobuf, <gr>Parrot</gr>, Myrddin, Ansible, Ant, Make, Go, Erlang, <gr>Lua</gr>, ActionScript, <gr>C</gr>, C++, Smalltalk, C#, <gr>Objective-C</gr>, Swift, PL/SQL, HTML, <gr>CSS</gr>, System css, <gr>JavaScript</gr>, CoffeeScript, Perl, <gr>PHP</gr>, Python, <gr>Ruby</gr>, Elixir, etc.</p>

<p>If you want a lightweight code editor on Mac, please refer another app developed by me: <a href="speare.html">Speare code editor</a>, the free small IDE for scripting languages.</p>


<h2>FTP Server Settings</h2>
<p><strong>1. On Macintosh:</strong> System Preferences → Sharing → File Sharing, check the service and got the IP address of your machine, then you can input it in the settings of iOSFinder.<br><br><a href="../images/editor/ftp.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/editor/ftp.png" alt="" class="screenshots"/></a><br><br>
<a href="uftp.html"><img src="../images/uftp/logo.png" alt="" style="width:32px;height:auto;vertical-align: -1ex;"/></a>Because macOS High Sierra removed the builtin FTP Server, there's an alternative solution: 
<a href="http://www.sevenuc.com/en/uftp.html">Personal FTP Server</a>, use the uFTP Server, your FTP settings of iOSFinder should be changed to: <b>192.168.1.4:2121</b>, i.e. append a port number to the server IP address and sperate with <b>a colon ":"</b>, for the example, the port number is 2121, then the appending string is <span class="warning">":2121"</span>, five characters. 
</p>

<p><strong>2. On Windows:</strong><br>
<ol><li>The Windows builtin FTP Server can be configured via IIS (Internet Information Services), please read <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us//library/hh831655.aspx">this article</a> and other articles about this subject on the website of Microsoft.</li>
<li>Free and Open Source solution: <a href="https://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla Server</a>, highly commended.</li>
