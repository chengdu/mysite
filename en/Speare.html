<p><a href="http://sevenuc.com/en/Speare.html">Speare </a>code editor is a small, free and friendly code editor, and a really ultra light IDE. You can use it to edit all kinds of text file, programming and debugging with almost all common programming languages. It designed to make programming feels light, simple and free. Speare code editor not only has an efficient code navigation and call routines tracing ability but also has flexibility to extend the IDE to support special developing requirements and easily to add a new programming language in it. Speare code editor includes <a href="debugger.html" target="_blank">builtin debugging environment</a> for C, C++, Ruby, mruby, Lua, Python, PHP, Perl and Tcl, and give you complete freedom to control and customise a debugging environment for any programming language.</p>

<h2 class="dark">What's new</h2>
<p class="dark">1. Improvement of "Lite Mode", i.e. hide toolbar and left side TreeView, this is useful and feels more light when open and edit several file but not work on a project that has large number of files. This function turn Speare to a TextEdit-like text editor but has more features, such as line number display, syntax highlighting etc.<br>
2. Highlighting files that has no extension name by recognise its Shebang, i.s. the first line of the text file.
</p>

<h2>Code editor and IDE on macOS</h2>
<p class="small">Terminal based on text editors such as GNU Emacs and Vim, although they are very cool, but their limitations are also obvious, the elephant in the room. TextMate is my favourite code editor long years ago and until today, but it still lack some features. As a programmer, so many IDE and text editors I've used in the past years, such as the bulky cargos, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Android Studio, Eclipse, ActiveState Komodo, Xcode, and some light cargos, e.g Textadept, CotEditor and TextMate. I never like the bulky cargos, e.g desktop applications that built with NodeJS, React and Electron, Eclipse and Java or .NET and C# based big stuffs. Speare code editor is a small, free and friendly code editor which implements the most important missing features in common code editors, e.g bookmark management and fast locate code lines between multiple files, code block live parsing etc.

<p>Speare code editor was developing based on the native pure Cocoa frameworks with leveraging several C library results a very small footprint, high performance, small memory and storage runtime consuming, and ultra small distribution. Only 1.1MB executable!</p>


<h2>Why not big software?</h2>
<p>Waste time to maintain, wast big storage and runtime memory, waste power, waste time to upload and download. It's waste people's life! Every desktop developer should known one thing, the embedded system developers sometime even fighting for one byte of storage in some situation. They never think about memory and storage like embedded system developers, so more and more big monster there. In today's software industry, Unix philosophy has been throw away completely!</p>

<p class="green">They make software as big as possible, as complex as possible, but I believe in the opposite philosophy. </p>


<h2>Why another code editor and IDE on macOS?</h2>
<p>Although there are so many code editor and IDE available on macOS, but three feature of Speare code editor can make it unique:<br>
<ol><li><lt>Lightweight.</lt> Most of them are very heavy, bulky, but Speare code editor is really really ultra light. Only 6.2MB!</li>
<li><lt>Cost.</lt> Most of them are very expensive, but Speare code editor is free! Of course, you can kindly purchase the pro version to donate some money to the author, but that is not mandatory.</li>
<li><lt>Freedom.</lt> Feels light, simple and free, high performance code editor, flexibility to extend the IDE to support special developing requirements and easily add a new programming language to it, most of the IDE on macOS can't give you such ability and freedom. In fact, Speare code editor give you very flexible control to extend it and add a debugging environment for any programming language.

</p>

<h2>Auto-completion Selection</h2>
<p>Type in class name, function name, or variable name or anything else, wait one to three seconds and use Up and Down arrow key to move selection in the candidates and click "Return" key to select one.</p>

<h2>SPP File</h2>
<p><b>SPP File</b> is the abbreviation of "Speare Project Plist" file, it is the project file type of Speare that has an .spp file extension, it packs variant of project meta information together, including project folder and its bookmark/breakpoints, watches, opened tabs, selection of each tab, current selected tab etc.<br>
<ol><li><b>Create SPP File</b><br>
	 Click menu: File → Save as Speare Project file. This operation will store the root path of the nodes in the left side Treeview as a .spp file.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Open SPP File</b><br>
	Directly dragging the .spp file into Treeview, or select menu "File"  →  "Open",  will load all indexed file and folder stored in the .spp file into the left side Treeview (Workspace Explorer).</li>
</ol></p>
<!--p><i><lt>Warning: when load a SPP File, current project will be removed!</i></lt></p-->
<p class="green"><span><img src="../images/Speare/tips.png" class="tips" /></span>When switch to another project, it is necessarily required to save current project so that the project meta information stored in .spp file and can be restore later otherwise these information will lost!</p>

<p><ltab><b>Brief &amp; History</b>: each search result has brief of the source line and all be classified, and the history of search words remembered automatically, click the down arrow of the search field will allow to select the searched items in history.</ltab></p>

<h2>Tab Selection and Dragging</h2>
<p><b>Speare</b> use tabs to manage multiple opened files on the right side, continuously click on the leftmost or rightmost tab can quickly scroll tabs to left side or right side so that opened files can be quickly switched. Dragging special tabs together will also can help simultaneously editing multiple files.<br><br>
<em class="green">Tips: click tab can fast select the node of left side Treeview when it loaded or reloaded end.</em><br>
</p>

<h2>File Rename and Save</h2>
<p><b>1. File Rename</b><br>
Click the item in the left side Treeview and input a new file name just like in Finder, and then click the left side icon to end editing.<br><br>
<b>2. File Save</b><br>
a). Speare can save file automatically whenever it be edited but the temporary "Untitled files" will be asked to save when quit the app or load a .spp file, because load a .spp file will remove current project.<br><br>
<i>In addition, Speare will change the icon colour of the item in the left side Treeview to indicate that it has been edited  whenever it be edited, and will restore to default state when click the "Save" or "Save All" button on the toolbar.</i><br><br>
b). Speare can save file with user selected text encoding and compatible with Windows line endings (i.e "\r\n").
</p>

You can also click the "Refresh" button on the bottom of the left site TreeView to reload the entire project, it may take a while to complete the loading for big project.</span> When you overwrite, rename, add or delete a file or folder in Finder, please right click its parent folder in the left side TreeView and click "Reload" on the popup menu. 
</p>

<h2>Syntax highlighting without file extension name</h2>
<p>Speare can recognise the programming language of a text file without file extension name by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)"> Shebang</a>, i.e, the first line of the text file. The configure file for this function is <span class="green">"/Applications/Speare.app/Contents/Resources/shebang.json"</span>, the default language includes Shell, Ruby, Python, Perl, Lua, PHP and Tcl, you can edit it to support more programming languages directly.

<span style="margin-left:68px;"> b. click any file item in the left side Treeview will also close preview automatically.</span></p>

<h2>Code Formatter</h2>
<p><lt>Click menu:</lt> Format → Re-Indent Selection.<br><br>
<b>Supported languages</b>:<br>
a. C, C++, Objective‑C, C#, Java (builtin support).<br>
b. Ruby, Lua, Python, Perl, PHP, Tcl, JavaScript, Shell scripts, Dart, Go, Rust.<br>
  (located in the formatters directory, and requires some modification to correctly working.)<br><br>
<b>Location of formatters:</b><br>
<lt>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.sevenuc.SpeareHelper/formatters</lt><br>
<lt>Please create the directory if it is not exists.</lt><br><br>
<i>If the formatters has not installed, in the prompt dialog, select subfolder "com.sevenuc.SpeareHelper" and then click "Install Code Formatters" button. This directory contains various code formatter (aka. code beautifier) that used to indent and format code block for Speare code editor. </i><br><br>
<b>The rule of formatter is</b>:<br>
Speare code editor will give up formatted code block if there's something printed in stderr or nothing printed in stdout otherwise anything printed in stdout will be used to replace the selected code block.<br><br>
Ensure the formatters correctly working, you should take a look at above directory, especially modify the shell script to match the path of executables (install interpreter or missing component), including: <br><br>
<lt>a. js.sh:</lt> check Node.js installed and can be accessed from command line.<br>
<lt>b. go.sh:</lt> check Go installed and can be accessed from command line.<br>
<lt>c. php.sh:</lt> check PHP installed and can be accessed from command line.<br>
<lt>d. rust.sh:</lt> check Rust and rustfmt installed and can be accessed from command line.<br>
<lt>e. tcl.sh:</lt> check Tcl installed and can be accessed from command line.<br>
<lt>f. dart.sh:</lt> check Dart and dartfmt installed and can be accessed from command line.<br><br>
<b>Note: </b>The selected code block is complete or has logical begin and end border then the formatter can generate better output.
</p>

<h2>Lite Mode</h2>
<p>Click <span><img src="../images/Speare/left.png" class="button" /></span> siding button on toolbar and then click menu "View → Hide Toolbar".<br>
"Lite Mode" can turn Speare to be a TextEdit-like text editor but has more features, such as line number display, syntax highlighting etc. "Lite Mode" can be remembered and continually keeping, it can be turned off by click menu "View → Show Toolbar". This function is useful and feels more light when open and edit several files but not work on a project that has large number of files.
</p>

<h2>Debug Mode</h2>
<p>Speare seamlessly support debugging C, C++, Ruby, mruby, Lua, Python, PHP, Perl and Tcl script, more info see here: <a href="debugger.html" target="_blank" > → Speare debugger architecture</a>.</p>

<h2>File and Folder Filter</h2>
<p>1. Click menu: View → Don't Show Hidden Files. Hide or display all hidden files.</p>
<p>2. Speare code editor uses a file named as <lt>".speareignore"</lt> to hidden directory and file that you don't want it displayed in the left side Treeview (Workspace Explorer).</p>

<h2>About Praat scripting</h2>
<p>1. Please download the syntax highlighting file <a href="http://sevenuc.com/download/Praat.plist.zip">(Praat.plist.zip)</a> for <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/" target="_blank">Praat scripts</a>, and put it under  <lt>"/Applications/Speare.app/Contents/Resources/Languages/"</lt>. <br>
2. Open <lt>"/Applications/Speare.app/Contents/Resources/FileExtensions.plist"</lt>, and carefully append the file extension name of Praat scripts in it, the end of the file is like the following:<br>
<pre>
...
       &lt;key&gt;Swift&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;swift&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
<span class="warning">
&lt;key&gt;Praat&lt;/key&gt; &lt;---- Praat.plist (file name for syntax highlighting)
&lt;array&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;praat&lt;/string&gt; &lt;---- file extension name
&lt;/array&gt;</span>
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;

<h2>Add a New Programming Language</h2>
<p>Download the guide from here: <a href="http://sevenuc.com/download/language_extension_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">language_extension_protocol.pdf</a>, and following the description to add a new programming language code runner, parser, syntax highlighting, code formatter and debugger in Speare code editor.</p>

<h2>Syntax Checking and Run Code Instantly</h2>
<p>a. Press shortcut key "Command + R".<br>
 b. Click menu: File → Run External Command.<br><br>
<b>Location of the shell scripts for the external commands:</b><br>
<span class="green">~/Library/Application Scripts/com.sevenuc.SpeareHelper/commands</span><br>
<lt>Please create the directory if it is not exists.</lt><br><br>
<i><span class="green">This is a common interface that enables end user to run code for various of tasks immediately, usually includes syntax checking, unit test, and run code snippets.</span><br><br>
You can put different of shell scripts in this directory to instantly run other tasks, such as automatic compile (run makefile or CMake etc), building and packing, or run static code analysis tool (source code analyzer, such as PC-Lint, clang-analyzer, PHPLint etc), and any other tasks. Speare code editor determine which shell script should be called by the extension name of the source code files. One shell script service for one programming language. Every script can accept two input parameters, the full path of the current selected file and the selected code block, and the last parameter is optional and can be empty string.</i><br>
<pre class="green">
#!/bin/bash
# $1 is the path of the current selected file
# $2 is the selected code block (optional)
ruby $1
</pre></p>
<p><i>The above is a sample shell script that accepts a file as input parameter and run it, if there's some syntax error, the error message will be printed in the debug output (the black area on bottom right ). Please execute "chmod +x" to ensure the script is executable. Speare code editor will merge stderr and stdout together and print them in the debug output.</i><br><br>
The map between the source code file extension names and the entry shell script name:<br>
<pre class="green">
c.sh: *.c 
cc.sh: *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp, *.c++
ruby.sh: *.rb
lua.sh: *.lua
python.sh: *.py
perl.sh: *.pl
php.sh: *.php
tcl.sh: *.tcl
js.sh: *.js
sh.sh: *.sh (shell script)
go.sh: *.go
rust.sh: *.rs
dart.sh: *.dart
</pre><br>
TO add a new programming language and associate its source code file extension names with an entry shell script, please refer this document: <a href="http://sevenuc.com/download/language_extension_protocol.pdf" target="_blank">language_extension_protocol.pdf</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Don't use this approach to run long running tasks but should launch Terminal.app to do such works.</p>

<h2 class="warning">Important Tips</h2>
<p class="green">
1. Please wait a while when loading very big project into Workspace.<br>
2. Use ESC key or arrow key or 'Control+Z' to get out of suggested words list selection.<br>
3. Please ensure all source code file and resource files have been dragged in the left side Treeview (Workspace Explorer) before start a debug session, because macOS app can't be allowed to access files outside of its sandbox.<br>
4. When your project sub folder moved to another place, please drag the project folder in Speare again to ensure the debugging can correctly work.</p>

<h2>Techniques Inside</h2>
<p><b>Speare is very fast!</b><br> Speare developed with pure Cocoa and C components that made it completely different with Javascript & Chromium based on IDE that large number of junk filled inside them, pure native frameworks and C modules made it small, efficient and has ability to leverage all native platform builtin features, e.g. Spell and grammar check, font and text format, unlimited undo, text to speak etc.</p>
