<h2> LittleFox <br><em> Version 1.5.14 </em></h2>

<p><b>LittleFox</b> is a small tool designed to help people synthesis subtitle with music and video in an efficient way. It was designed to conveniently synthesis subtitle with audio and video without traditional boring works. It helps end user share music or video on social websites or make slideshows with speech audio and pictures in a simple and efficient way. With the help of it, you can burn your favourite mp3 to video with lyrics sheet in several minutes, make slideshows by merging pictures with speech audio, synchronise some words to an exists video, or just scale the resolution of your videos to slim them so that you can very easily share them with a very small file size.</p>

<h2>Share music and video on social websites</h2>
<p>LittleFox can produce very smaller video file than original mp3 or mp4 file so that the produced output file can be suitable to share on social websites, such as Twitter, Youtube, Vimeo, Netflix etc.</p>


<h2>Synthesising Types</h2>
<table><tr><th>Id</th><th>Input</th><th>Output</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Audio + Subtitle</td><td>MP4 video</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Audio + Pictures + Subtitle</td><td>MP4 video</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Video + Subtitle</td><td>MP4 video</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Video + Pictures + Subtitle</td><td>MP4 video</td></tr>
</table>
<p class="green"><i>Each synthesising type can put the subtitle in the bottom of the outside margin without video area overlay. Subtitle can be split into two type of content and each type of content can have different font and colour style, and can contains two lines of text, so the maximum number of line count in the external margin area is four lines of text.</i></p>

<b>How to turn my favourite mp3 to video with lyrics sheet?</b><br><br>
The follow are the steps that how to synthesis music with lyrics sheet. Surely you can also synchronise speech audio with pictures using the same steps, this is an very conveniently approach to make slideshow with speech audio.<br>
<b>Step 1.</b> Click <span><img src="../images/littlefox/tex.png" class="button" /></span> to load lyrics sheet file, the app will parse the file line by line automatically. The lyrics sheet file can be easily generated by <a href="http://www.sevenuc.com/en/lyricsmaker.html" target="_blank">LyricsMaker</a>, an efficient small tool designed to smoothly pair working with LittleFox. 
</p>

<p class="small">
What is the relation between LittleFox and LyricsMaker?<br><br>
LyricsMaker designed to generate lyrics sheet but LittleFox designed to burn audio or video with lyrics sheet to movie. LittleFox just uses lyrics sheet as text format to know when words should be showing in the final movie.
</p>

<p><b>Step 2.</b> Right click any original line of the parsed lyrics then click the prompt menu item "<b>Add Image</b>" to load a image file for the selected line. The image file should be PNG or JPEG file format that always has a .png, .jpg or .jpeg extension name. You can click "<b>Preview Image</b>" to view a more bigger size of the loaded image and can click "<b>Remove Image</b>" to delete it if you don't want it. Add pictures to audio is optional, LittleFox can synthesis audio with lyrics sheet and output movie without any image loaded, so you can skip this step directly.<br>
<b>Step 3.</b> Click <span><img src="../images/littlefox/audio.png" class="button" /></span> to choose an audio file and then the app immediately ask you to select an output directory that the final output movie file will be placed there, the file has a same name with the audio file but with a .mp4 extension name.
</p>

<span class="warning">Audio File Convert (Prepare stage, Optional):</span><br>
Please ready your audio file with standard 44100 sample rate will be better. Open your audio file with Audacity, on its bottom left corner  →  Project Rate (Hz) make sure 44100 selected, and then export to mp3 or wav.<br>
</p>
